Minimum version 11 

Dependencies:

Spring Web


In the application.properties file, set the server.port variable to 9000.

We'll turn this app into a REST API:
Depending on the main package, create another subpackage called Controllers, and inside it, add the HelloWorldController class.


It should have two methods:
String greets
String greets2

These two methods will receive a String parameter called name, and return the phrase:

“Hello, “ + name + “. You are running a Maven project”.


The first method will respond to a GET request, and must be configured to receive the parameter as a RequestParam. The "name" parameter will have the default value "UNKNOWN".

You will have to answer to:

http://localhost:9000/HelloWorld
http://localhost:9000/HelloWorld?name=My name

 

The second method will respond to a GET request, and must be configured to receive the parameter as a PathVariable. The "name" parameter will be optional.

You will have to answer to:

http://localhost:9000/HelloWorld2
http://localhost:9000/HelloWorld2/myname
